# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the video processing pipeline for a YOLO object detection web application. The system allows users to upload videos, select inference models, view live processing results, and save detection counts to a database. The primary issue to resolve is premature termination of video processing before completion.

## Glossary

- **YOLO_System**: The object detection inference system that processes video frames
- **Video_Processor**: The component responsible for handling video file processing from start to finish
- **Web_App**: The Flask-based web application that serves the user interface
- **Database_Manager**: The component that handles saving detection counts and results
- **Live_Feed**: Real-time streaming of processed video frames to the user interface
- **Model_Selector**: The interface component allowing users to choose inference models
- **Count_Tracker**: The system component that tracks total and class-wise object counts

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload a video file for object detection analysis, so that I can get detection results for the entire video.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a video file, THE Web_App SHALL accept common video formats (mp4, avi, mov, mkv)
2. THE Web_App SHALL validate the uploaded video file size and format before processing
3. IF the video file is invalid or corrupted, THEN THE Web_App SHALL display an error message to the user
4. THE Web_App SHALL store the uploaded video temporarily for processing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select a YOLO model for inference, so that I can choose the appropriate detection model for my use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Web_App SHALL display available YOLO models from the model directory
2. WHEN a user selects a model, THE Web_App SHALL load the selected model for inference
3. THE Web_App SHALL validate that the selected model file exists and is accessible
4. IF model loading fails, THEN THE Web_App SHALL display an error message and allow model reselection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see live processing results while the video is being analyzed, so that I can monitor the detection progress in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video processing starts, THE Video_Processor SHALL stream processed frames to the Live_Feed
2. THE Live_Feed SHALL display detection bounding boxes and class labels on video frames
3. THE Live_Feed SHALL update the display with current frame processing status
4. THE Web_App SHALL maintain responsive user interface during video processing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the video processing to complete for the entire video duration, so that I get complete detection results without premature termination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Video_Processor SHALL process every frame from start to end of the video file
2. THE Video_Processor SHALL handle processing errors gracefully without stopping the entire pipeline
3. WHEN processing encounters a problematic frame, THE Video_Processor SHALL log the error and continue with the next frame
4. THE Video_Processor SHALL provide progress indicators showing current frame position and total frames
5. THE Video_Processor SHALL only terminate when all frames have been processed or user explicitly stops the process

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the detection counts to be saved to the database after processing, so that I can review and analyze the results later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video processing completes, THE Count_Tracker SHALL calculate total object counts across all frames
2. THE Count_Tracker SHALL calculate class-wise object counts for each detected object type
3. THE Database_Manager SHALL save the total count and class-wise counts to the database
4. THE Database_Manager SHALL associate the saved counts with the processed video metadata
5. IF database saving fails, THEN THE Web_App SHALL display an error message but retain the processing results

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to stop video processing if needed, so that I have control over long-running operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Web_App SHALL provide a stop/cancel button during video processing
2. WHEN the user clicks stop, THE Video_Processor SHALL gracefully terminate the current processing
3. THE Video_Processor SHALL save partial results up to the point of termination
4. THE Web_App SHALL display the processing status as "stopped by user" when manually terminated

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access processed videos for review later, so that I can analyze detection results and share them with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Video_Processor SHALL save the processed video with detection overlays to a designated output directory
2. THE Web_App SHALL provide a download link for the processed video after completion
3. THE Database_Manager SHALL store the file path of the processed video for future retrieval
4. THE Web_App SHALL display a list of previously processed videos with their metadata
5. WHEN a user selects a previously processed video, THE Web_App SHALL allow playback or download of the processed video
